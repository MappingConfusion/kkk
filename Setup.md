1. Install the latest version of [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Start up [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/), and navigate to your desired profile.
3. Ensure that you've installed [AnkiConnect](https://github.com/FooSoft/anki-connect).
4. If you are a new user, download `obstoanki_setup.py` from the [releases page](https://github.com/Pseudonium/Obsidian_to_Anki/releases), and place it in the folder you want the script installed (for example your notes folder).  
5. Run `obstoanki_setup.py`, for example by double-clicking it in a file explorer. This will download the latest version of the script and required dependencies automatically. Existing users should be able to run their existing `obstoanki_setup.py` to get the latest version of the script.  
6. Check [[Permissions]] to ensure the script is able to run.
7. Run `obsidian_to_anki.py`, for example by double-clicking it in a file explorer. This will generate a config file, `obsidian_to_anki_config.ini`.
