If you are a **new user**, these steps are recommended:
1. Check [Custom syntax](regex.md) to see if there is a template that works for you.
2. Then, check the information on the following topics:
 * **Adding to user-specified [decks](#deck-formatting),** on a *per-file* basis.
 * **[Markdown formatting](#markdown-formatting)**, including **[math formatting](#math-formatting)**
 * **[Embedded images](#image-formatting)**. GIFs should work too.
 * **[Auto-deleting notes](#deleting-notes) from the file**.
 * **[File tag formatting](#file-tag-formatting)**.
 * **[Easy cloze formatting](#cloze-formatting)** - A more compact syntax to do Cloze text
 * [Defaults](#default).
3. You should be good to go simply running the script with the 'Regex' option checked.
